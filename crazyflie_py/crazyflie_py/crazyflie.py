        The full-state setpoint is most useful for aggressive maneuvers where
        feedforward inputs for acceleration and angular velocity are critical
        to obtaining good tracking performance. Full-state setpoints can be
        obtained from any trajectory parameterization that is at least three
        times differentiable, e.g. piecewise polynomials.

        Sending a streaming setpoint of any type will force a change from
        high-level to low-level command mode. Currently, there is no mechanism
        to change back, but it is a high-priority feature to implement.
        This means it is not possible to use e.g. :meth:`land()` or
        :meth:`goTo()` after a streaming setpoint has been sent.
